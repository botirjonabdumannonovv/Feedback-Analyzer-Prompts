sentiment, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nInstructions:\nCollect Feedback: Compile the user feedback to be analyzed.\n\nDetermine Sentiment:\n\nUse sentiment analysis tools or manual assessment to evaluate the tone and mood of each feedback comment.\nClassify each piece of feedback as either positive, negative, or neutral based on its content and tone.\nExpected Output:\nOverall Sentiment: Categorize each feedback as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'.\nResult:\nOpinion Mining: A list categorizing user feedback into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments based on the analysis.\n\nAsadbek aka, [3/6/2024 7:35 PM]\nOpinion Points Collection:\nObjective: Extract and organize specific positive and negative points from user feedback.\n\nInstructions:\nIdentify Positive and Negative Points:\n\nReview the feedback and note distinct positive and negative points mentioned by users.\nOrganize Points:\n\nList the positive points separately from the negative ones for clarity.\nExpected Output:\nPositive Opinion Points: A collection of specific positive aspects or experiences mentioned by users.\nNegative Opinion Points: A collection of specific negative aspects or experiences mentioned by users.\nResult:\nOpinion Points Collection: Lists of both positive and negative points extracted from the user feedback.\n\nAsadbek aka, [3/6/2024 7:35 PM]\nCategorize Opinions from User Feedback:\nObjective: Sort user opinions into defined categories to better understand feedback areas such as product features, service quality, delivery, etc.\n\nInstructions:\nReview and Sort Feedback:\n\nRead through user feedback and identify main topics or themes.\nSort feedback into relevant categories based on these themes.\nAssign Categories:\n\nDefine categories relevant to your business or product, such as Delivery, Product Quality, Customer Service, Pricing, etc.\nPlace each piece of feedback into the appropriate category.\nExpected Output:\nGrouped Opinions: Feedback organized into categories with corresponding user opinions.\nResult:\nCategorized Opinions: A list of feedback categories each followed by the relevant user opinions.\n\nAsadbek aka, [3/6/2024 7:39 PM]\nfeedback relevance\n\nAsadbek aka, [3/6/2024 7:39 PM]\nFeedback Relevance Analysis:\nObjective: Determine whether the user feedback is relevant to specific products, services, or topics.\n\nInstructions:\nDefine Criteria for Relevance: Establish what makes the feedback relevant to your product or service (e.g., mentions specific features, addresses service quality).\n\nAnalyze Feedback: Assess each piece of feedback against the relevance criteria.\n\nDetermine Relevance:\n\nIf the feedback meets the established criteria, classify it as relevant (True).\nIf it does not, classify it as irrelevant (False).\nExpected Output:\nRelevance Analysis: A boolean value indicating whether each piece of feedback is relevant ('True' for relevant, 'False' for irrelevant).\nResult:\nFeedback Relevance: A list showing whether each feedback item is considered relevant or not.\n\nAsadbek aka, [3/6/2024 7:39 PM]\nExtract Relevant Parts from Feedback:\nObjective: Identify and extract the portions of user feedback that are relevant to the product or service.\n\nInstructions:\nIdentify Relevant Content: Scan through the feedback to find segments that specifically relate to your criteria for relevance.\n\nExtract and Compile: Extract these relevant segments from each piece of feedback.\n\nCalculate Relevance Percentage:\n\nEstimate what proportion of the feedback is relevant based on the extracted content.\nExpected Output:\nRelevant Parts: The extracted segments of feedback that meet the relevance criteria.\nRelevance Percentage: An estimation of how much of the feedback is relevant to the topics of interest.\nResult:\nExtracted Relevance: A string of relevant feedback parts and their corresponding relevance percentage.\n\nAsadbek aka, [3/6/2024 7:39 PM]\nPII Extraction from User Feedback:\nObjective: Identify and redact any personally identifiable information (PII) present in user feedback to protect privacy.\n\nInstructions:\nIdentify PII: Look for common types of PII such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, or any unique identifiers within the feedback.\n\nRedact PII: Replace identified PII with a generic placeholder or redaction mark (e.g., \"[REDACTED]\").\n\nExpected Output:\nRedacted Feedback: The user feedback with all PII removed or obscured.\nResult:\nPII-Free Feedback: A version of the feedback with all personal information appropriately redacted.\n\nAsadbek aka, [3/6/2024 7:39 PM]\nLanguage Recognition from User Feedback:\nObjective: Determine the language used in user feedback.\n\nInstructions:\nCollect Feedback Samples: Aggregate a set of feedback for analysis.\n\nAnalyze Language: Use language detection tools or manual methods to identify the language of each feedback piece.\n\nExpected Output:\nLanguage Locale: The identified language of each piece of feedback, represented by its locale code (e.g., 'en-US' for American English).\nResult:\nFeedback Languages: A list showing the language locale for each piece of feedback.\n\nAsadbek aka, [3/6/2024 7:43 PM]\n....added product description and user feedback\n\nAsadbek aka, [3/6/2024 7:43 PM]\nFeedback Relevance Analysis:\nObjective: Determine whether the user feedback is relevant to specific products, services, or topics.\n\nProduct Description:\n{productDescription}: A brief overview of the product or service being reviewed.\nUser Feedback:\n{userFeedback}: Actual feedback provided by the user.\nInstructions:\nDefine Criteria
