            ##Calculate Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):
                ##Objective: Measure the level of customer satisfaction from specific interactions or experiences with the product/service.
                    
                 ##Instructions:
                   Collect Satisfaction Responses:
                    
                    Compile user responses to the CSAT survey question: ""How satisfied were you with your experience/product?"" Responses are typically on a scale (e.g., 1-5 or 1-10).
                    Calculate Average Score:
                    
                    Compute the average score from all the customer responses.
                    Interpret Results:
                    
                    Based on the average score, determine the general level of customer satisfaction.
                    
                 ##Product Description:
                    {productDescription}

                 ##User Feedback:
                    {userFeedback}

                   Expected Output:
                    Customer Satisfaction Score: The average score of all customer responses.
                 ##Result:
                   CSAT Calculation:
                    Example: ""With an average score of 8.5 out of 10, customer satisfaction is high.""
