But yeah, if there is a mouse company out there that can do that then I would buy straight away for sure. I find the Razer software incredibly easy to function with too, which does help me stick to the mouse than go back to one of my previous mice. But what mouse would you say is closest to a decent bump with the 6° slants as of right now??"
