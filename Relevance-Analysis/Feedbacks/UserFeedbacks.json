      "comment": "Razer may have a reputation for producing heavier mice, but their history shows they've also excelled in creating lightweight options. Take the Krait series, for example, with models like the 2006 original weighing just around 77g. Even the Abyssus and Salmosa from their lineup boasted weights lighter than the Viper. It's fascinating to see how Razer has evolved over the years to cater to various preferences in mouse weight and design."

Additionally, objective comparisons of features like cable quality among different mouse models, as highlighted by reviewers like BT and Badseed, shed light on the nuances of each product. Concerns about rubberized side grips, as mentioned, also emphasize the importance of material choice in mouse construction."

The company's dedication to optimizing their products, as seen in the non-frill design and onboard memory of their latest mouse, reflects their pursuit of excellence. It's worth noting that issues with QA are not unique to Razer, with other brands facing similar challenges. This underscores the importance of fair evaluation and recognition of efforts made to improve product quality."

While disappointed by initial impressions, the user's willingness to give the Viper a chance speaks volumes about their dedication to finding the perfect mouse. It's a reminder that preferences vary greatly among gamers, with some prioritizing button responsiveness over weight."

It's clear that what constitutes a 'clone' is subjective, with factors like shape and button feel playing significant roles. The user's request for comparative shapes of recent mice further emphasizes the importance of ergonomics in mouse selection."

      "comment": "The user's dilemma between the GPW and the Razor Viper highlights the importance of considering individual grip styles and preferences when choosing a gaming mouse. Concerns about the GPW's lack of grip grooves and the Viper's button responsiveness underscore the need for thorough research and testing before making a decision. Ultimately, the recommendation would depend on the user's specific requirements and gaming habits."
