            Calculate Customer Effort Score (CES):
                  ##Objective: Evaluate the ease with which customers can interact with your product/service based on their feedback.
                    
                ##Instructions:
                    Gather Effort Responses:
                    
                    Collect responses to the CES question: ""On a scale from 'Very Easy' to 'Very Hard', how easy was it to use our product/service?""
                    Calculate Average Ease:
                    
                    Determine the average response value, translating qualitative answers into a quantitative scale if necessary.
                    Assess Customer Effort:
                    
                    Analyze the average score to understand how much effort customers feel they are putting into using your product or service.
                 
                ##Product Description:
                    {productDescription}

                ##User Feedback:
                    {userFeedback}

                  Expected Output:
                    Customer Effort Score: The average of all responses, indicating the overall customer effort level.
               ##Result:
                    CES Calculation:
                    Example: ""With an average response leaning towards 'Easy', the customer effort score suggests a positive user experience.""
